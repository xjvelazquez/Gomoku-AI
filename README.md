Assignment 3: Gomoku with Monte Carlo Tree Search
=========

Your task is to implement MCTS for playing Gomoku. The base game engine is from [here](https://github.com/HackerSir/PygameTutorials/tree/master/Lesson04/Gomoku). 

The Game
-----
Gomoku is a popular game played on the Go board, following much simpler rules. 

- There are two players, one placing black pieces and the other white pieces, at the grid intersections of the board. 
- The two players take turns to place one piece each time. Pieces are never moved or removed from the board. 
- The players' goal is to have five pieces of their own color to form an unbroken line horizontally (`examples/ex1.png`), vertically (`examples/ex2.png`), or diagonally (`examples/ex3.png`). Of course, these are unlikely realistic games between reasonable players. A real game is more like `examples/ex4.png` (black is still very lame at the end).  
- The game engine starts with human against a random-play agent. Click any grid intersections and see what the computer does. Press enter to see a random game between two random-play agents (also press enter to pause autoplay and switch back to human vs random). Press 'm' to switch to manually playing both sides.  

Tasks
-----
Implement MCTS in `ai.py`. Read the comments carefully, as well as the pseudocode in the `MCTS_full.pdf` file in this repository.

Note that the starter code makes it clear that your MCTS should return more than just one action in the end, but also the table of winning rates for all actions for the root node. The tests compare these values that you compute with the correct ones for a few predefined states. 

In MCTS, the search exits when the "computation budget" is reached (Line 20 in `ai.py`). The current default value is 1000, which will be used for testing. You can increase or decrease it to see the different behaviors of AI. For instance, with a budget over 6000, a correctly implemented MCTS AI should be able to play a fairly interesting game against you (although it may still make some obvious mistakes when the number of next actions to consider gets larger). Check the MCTS-1000.mov and MCTS-6000.mov files in the repo for MCTS with 1000 and 6000 budgets respectively.

It is easy to see that good moves should be pretty close to the pieces already on the board. Thus, to accelerate search, we have limited the search to a small "active" area around existing pieces (this area uses black lines on the board, compared to grey lines in the inactive area).
